# AudioShadowPlay
ShadowPlay but for audio. 

Commissioned by Daniel Rieck.

## How it works
- Temporarily stores all audio.
- When a button is pushed past audio is retreived from the temporary audio and saved.
- This gives the same effect as shadow play by NVIDIA.

## Features

- Customisable save intervals
- High Quality Audio
- Variable sampling rate
- Data is stored in %appdata%/ASP/
